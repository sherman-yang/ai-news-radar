# Source Coverage Plan

This project should help ordinary AI enthusiasts scan high-signal updates
without forcing them to follow noisy timelines or manage many source choices.

## Product Model

Use a two-layer model:

1. **Signal layer**: the default web UI. It should show curated AI/tech updates,
   WaytoAGI changes, search, site filtering, and a simple AI-focused / all toggle.
2. **Advanced layer**: maintainer and power-user workflows. It includes OPML,
   source health data, GitHub Actions secrets, and custom fetchers.

Do not expose every source-management decision in the first screen. Too many
choices make the tool harder for new users to understand.

## Supported Source Types

| Source type | Current support | Recommended path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Official RSS / Atom | Supported through OPML | Add to `feeds/follow.opml` locally, or `FOLLOW_OPML_B64` in GitHub Actions | Best default for personal customization. |
| OPML collections | Supported | Export from RSS reader, copy from `feeds/follow.example.opml`, keep private file out of git | Good for cross-device and multi-agent workflows. |
| Public JSON APIs | Supported by custom Python fetchers | Add a `fetch_*` function in `scripts/update_news.py` and register it in the task list | Use only stable APIs with timestamps. |
| Public static pages | Supported by custom Python fetchers | Parse with `requests` + BeautifulSoup and normalize titles/URLs/times | Avoid fragile selectors when possible. |
| GitHub releases/blogs | Usually supported through Atom/RSS | Prefer GitHub Atom feeds or official blog RSS | Useful for model/platform/tool release tracking. |
| Newsletters | Partially supported | Prefer public archive RSS or stable archive pages | Do not scrape private inboxes. |
| X / Twitter | Not recommended as a default | Use curated lists, topic feeds, or manual sources only when high-signal | Following a person often imports too much noise. |
| WeChat public accounts | Not recommended as a default | Use stable third-party RSS only if the maintainer accepts breakage risk | Login/copyright/bridge stability can be poor. |
| Telegram / Bilibili / Zhihu / podcasts | Skipped by default when feeds are unreliable | Add only as opt-in OPML entries | These can be noisy or bridge-dependent. |

## Source Selection Rules

Add a source only when it passes most of these checks:

- Publishes AI, model, developer tool, or tech industry updates with low noise.
- Has a stable URL, feed, API, or page structure.
- Provides usable timestamps or enough ordering information.
- Does not require private cookies, login sessions, browser automation, or secrets.
- Can be fetched politely by GitHub Actions without heavy rate limits.
- Adds coverage not already represented by stronger sources.

## Personal Source Workflow

For a private custom setup:

1. Copy `feeds/follow.example.opml` to `feeds/follow.opml`.
2. Add official RSS/Atom feeds to `feeds/follow.opml`.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   python scripts/update_news.py --output-dir data --window-hours 24 --rss-opml feeds/follow.opml
   ```

4. Check `data/source-status.json` for `failed_feeds`, `zero_item_feeds`,
   `skipped_feeds`, and `replaced_feeds`.
5. Keep `feeds/follow.opml` private. For GitHub Actions, store its base64
   content in the `FOLLOW_OPML_B64` secret.

## Adding A Built-In Source

Use this only for sources that should benefit every public visitor:

1. Add a `fetch_<source_name>(session, now)` function in `scripts/update_news.py`.
2. Return `RawItem` objects with `site_id`, `site_name`, `source`, `title`, `url`,
   `published_at`, and `meta`.
3. Register the fetcher in the built-in task list.
4. Normalize URLs and dates using existing helpers.
5. Update this document if the source changes coverage.
6. Run the fastest relevant checks:

   ```bash
   python -m py_compile scripts/update_news.py
   pytest -q
   ```

## Deployment

The public deployment should remain GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions:

- GitHub Actions updates `data/*.json`.
- GitHub Pages serves `index.html` and `assets/*`.
- Private OPML input belongs in `FOLLOW_OPML_B64`, not in the repository.

This keeps the public version easy to fork while still letting each maintainer
bring their own private source list.
